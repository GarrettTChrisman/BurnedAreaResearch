Wildfire Burned Area Classification Using U-Net and Sentinel Data

Project Overview
This project employs a U-Net convolutional neural network to classify and map wildfire burned areas using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI data. The method integrates advanced machine learning techniques with satellite data to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of burn area detection under varied environmental conditions, particularly overcoming challenges like cloud cover and smoke.
