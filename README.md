# Wildfire Burned Area Classification Using U-Net and Sentinel Data

## Introduction
This repository houses the findings from using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI data processed with a U-Net convolutional neural network to classify wildfire burned areas in Colorado. The study improves the accuracy and speed of burn area assessments under cloud cover and smoke.

## Project Overview
As wildfires become more frequent and intense, effective monitoring is critical. This project uses synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi-spectral imaging (MSI) to identify burned areas more reliably than traditional methods. The U-Net model is tailored for detailed segmentation, suitable for the precision needed in wildfire analysis.

## Research Impact
The use of SAR and MSI data together enhances detection capabilities:
- Allows for quicker and more accurate mapping of burn areas.
- Works under conditions where optical methods fail due to clouds or smoke.

## Results
The approach was tested on data from seven major wildfires, showing that integrating SAR with MSI through neural networks enhances burn area detection. These results suggest that the method is suitable for operational use and could improve current monitoring techniques.

## Data
All data used in this project were accessed via Google Earth Engine, enabling the handling of large datasets and complex processing efficiently.
